# FantomTestnet

**Auto Faucet Fantom Testnet**

## Overview

FantomTestnet is a Python automation script that helps developers and testers automatically request FTM testnet tokens from the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/) for the Fantom Testnet. This tool streamlines the process of acquiring testnet tokens for smart contract development and testing.

## Features

- Automates the process of requesting FTM testnet tokens
- Uses browser automation to interact with the Chainlink Faucet
- Simple and easy to use

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer) Python package

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/borilliano/FantomTestnet.git
cd FantomTestnet
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyppeteer
```

## Usage

1. Open `fantom.py` and replace `0xYourFantomTestnetWalletAddress` with your Fantom Testnet wallet address.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python fantom.py
```

The script will launch a browser, navigate to the Chainlink Faucet, and attempt to request FTM testnet tokens for your address.

## Notes

- **Wallet Connection:** This script does **not** automate connecting wallet extensions (like MetaMask). For full automation, consider Node.js with Puppeteer and dappeteer.
- **Selectors:** If the faucet website changes, you may need to update the selectors in `fantom.py`.
- **Responsible Use:** Please use this tool responsibly and do not abuse public testnet faucets.
